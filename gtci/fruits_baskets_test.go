/*
Problem:
- Given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree,
  you are given two baskets and your goal is to put maximum number of fruits
  in each basket.

Constraints:
- Each basket can have only one type of fruit.
- You can start with any tree, but once you have started you canâ€™t skip a tree.
  You will pick one fruit from each tree until you cannot, i.e., you will stop
  when you have to pick from a third fruit type.

Example:
- Input: fruits=["apple", "orange", "coconut", "apple", "coconut"]
  Output: 3
  Explanation: Can put 2 "cocunut" in 1 basket and 1 "apple" in other from
  subarray ["coconut", "apple", "coconut"]

Approach:
- Similar to "longest substring with k distinct characters" with k=2.

Cost:
- O(n) time, O(k) space where k is the number of characters in the map.
